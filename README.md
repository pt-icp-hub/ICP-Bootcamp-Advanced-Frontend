## 🎯 Advanced Challenges

Please do challenges in order. You can submit already when finishing Challenge 2. If you can, feel free to do all challenges (by order).

### ✅ **Challenge 1: Improve the React + Tailwind Frontend for a Simple dApp**

- Build a **responsive UI** with modern design
- Implement Tailwind and have the project looking good for new features being added

#### 💡 Tips

- Learn about Tailwind [Core Concepts](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/styling-with-utility-classes)
- Start adding some scaffolding (rows and collumns) and any needed [components](https://tailwindui.com/components).

### ✅ **Challenge 2: Implement Identity Kit for Authentication**

- Add **Identity Kit** to your frontend ([Installation Docs](https://docs.identitykit.xyz/getting-started/installation))
- Add both NFID and Interner Identity as providers (wallets).
- Create a page with restricted access to **authenticated users**
- Display **user principal** and **user account id**

### ✅ **Challenge 3: Deploy NNS Ledger (on local) and show current balance of ICP**

- Deploy the nns locally (it will have the ICP Ledger with it)
- Show current balance of ICP (stored at account ID).

#### 💡 Tips
- See ["dfx extension install sns"](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-nns/#dfx-nns-install)
- And also how to access a local "rich account", from where you can make transfers from. (see the bottom of that page/link just above)

### ✅ **Challenge 4: Implement Receive a Top Up and then "charge" a Payment**

- Ask user to transfer ICP to Account ID and allow to update with a refresh of page or spinner button.
- Have a button saying "pay 0.1 ICP" and charge it when clicked.
- Store on a variable (in backend) how many times it was purchased and render it in frontend.
